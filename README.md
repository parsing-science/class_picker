# Class Picker

This is a small Flask project that will randomly select one one name from a list of names. The main use case would be for teachers wanting to randomly select one student in their class. 

This project is not live yet, but hopefully will be soon.

I plan to add more enhancements in the future including:
- Random selection without replacement
- A table that displays how many times each student has been chosen
- A grouping feature that will select subgroups of size n from the list of students.

# Getting Started
1) Download the files: either by cloning this git repo or downloading the zip file
2)In the command line, go to the main folder and type ./run.py
