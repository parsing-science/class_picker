# Class Picker

This is a small Flask project randomly cycles through a list of students.

This project is not live on any website yet, but hopefully will be soon.

I plan to add more enhancements in the future including:
- Allowing the teacher to cycle through the class multiple times.
- A table that displays how many times each student has been chosen
- A grouping feature that will select subgroups of size n from the list of students.

# Getting Started
1) Download the files: either by cloning this git repo or downloading the zip file

2) In the command line, go to the main folder and type ./run.py
